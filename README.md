Some themes are hard-coded to the colors generated from the wallpaper found in this repository under `~/Pictures/Wallpaper/Wallpaper.jpg` or are hard-coded to look for cached colors in `/home/brent/.cache/wal`. Where I could and where it worked, I tried to import colors from cached palettes, but some applications would not accept this or I didn't know how to do it. Most of these configs are based on the great work done by Eli Fouts https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles/
